This script was used to create repos within an organization under a GitHub enterprise account.

To use this script, you first need an OAuth token. This can be obtained by opening up your terminal and executing the following command:

`curl -i -u <username> -d '{"scopes":["repo","user"], "note":"getting-started"}' https://hostname/api/v3/authorizations`

where:

* `<username>` is your username within the organisation
* `hostname` is your enterprise GitHub URL
* Parameters for `scopes` can be found [here](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/)

The OAuth token is generated and displayed just **ONCE**. Please treat this as a password (since this uniquely authenticates you) and store it somewhere safe.

At lines 13, 23, 35, 45 please make note of the arguments. 

* `<token>` is where you replace with the OAuth token that you obtained in the previous step
* `{org-name}` is the organisation where you wish to create your repositories.
* `hostname` is your GitHub Enterprise URL

Output generated by the cURL commands have been saved in a file called `output_log.txt`

To run this file, simply navigate to the path where the file is present and execute the following command:

`sh sample_script.sh`
